## Application Overview
The purpose of this project was two-fold. The first creation of this site was to become familiar with the concept of using a framwork for css and allowing me to style my previously, HTML only site using bootstrap. The second purpose of the application is to create a viable, and unique portfolio to showcase my skills and ability as I learn to program in various languages and tools.

## Tech Used
* HTML
* Bootstrap
* CSS
* Popper JS
* Fontawesome
* Google Fonts

## Details of the Application
I have used a multiple page layout to house my portfolio. I have a landing page that is about me, and my interestests and experience. There is a working navbar with navigation links, with a connection to a contact page that has my various methods of contacting me about a job. I also have a portfolio linked page, that includes links to all of my active works that I intend to showcase to prospective employers
